        <h1 class="text-center text-3xl font-bold">Var, Let, and Const - What's the Difference?</h1>
            <div class="mt-4 bg-white p-5 rounded-lg">
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Var</h1>
                <p>
                    Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables
                    declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to
                    emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">Scope of var</h1>
                <p>
                    Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are
                    globally scoped or function/locally scoped. The scope is global when a var variable is declared
                    outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function
                    block is available for use in the whole window. var is function scoped when it is declared
                    within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that
                    function.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">var variables can be re-declared and updated</h1>
                <p>This means that we can do this within the same scope and won't get an error.</p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">Hoisting of var</h1>
                <p>
                    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the
                    top of their scope before code execution.
