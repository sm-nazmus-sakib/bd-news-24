            <h1 class="text-center text-3xl font-bold">Var, Let, and Const - What's the Difference?</h1>
            <div class="mt-4 bg-white p-5 rounded-lg">
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Var</h1>
                <p>
                    Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables
                    declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to
                    emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">Scope of var</h1>
                <p>
                    Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are
                    globally scoped or function/locally scoped. The scope is global when a var variable is declared
                    outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function
                    block is available for use in the whole window. var is function scoped when it is declared
                    within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that
                    function.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">var variables can be re-declared and updated</h1>
                <p>This means that we can do this within the same scope and won't get an error.</p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">Hoisting of var</h1>
                <p>
                    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the
                    top of their scope before code execution.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-4 bg-white p-5 rounded-lg">
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Let</h1>
                <p>
                    let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to
                    var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why
                    this is so.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">let is block scoped</h1>
                <p>
                    A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly
                    braces is a block. So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within
                    that block.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">let can be updated but not re-declared.</h1>
                <p>
                    Just like var, a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let
                    variable cannot be re-declared within its scope.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">Hoisting of let</h1>
                <p>
                    Just like var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as
                    undefined, the let keyword is not initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before
                    declaration, you'll get a Reference Error.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-4 bg-white p-5 rounded-lg">
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Const</h1>
                <p>
                    Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some
                    similarities with let declarations.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">const declarations are block scoped</h1>
                <p>
                    Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were
                    declared.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">const cannot be updated or re-declared</h1>
                <p>
                    This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope.
                    It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">Hoisting of const</h1>
                <br>
                Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized. So just in
                case you missed the differences, here they are:</br>
                <li> var declarations are globally scoped or function
                    scoped while let and const are block scoped. </li>
                <li>var variables can be updated and re-declared within
                    its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared;
                    const variables can neither be
                    updated nor re-declared.</li>
                <li> They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables
                    are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.</li>
                <li> While var and let
                    can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</li>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-5 bg-white p-5 rounded-lg">
                <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.
                    Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the
                    arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
                    constructor functions.</p>
